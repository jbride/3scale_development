    The course description has a 4000 character limit

    To provide enough information for a sufficiently detailed description, be sure that your description answers the following questions:
    What is the specific product/solution that the course focuses on?
    What topics relating to that product/solution are covered?
    What are the main tasks that the student will perform during the course?
    What is the end result of taking the course? What skills and knowledge will the student gain? What will the student be able to do?
  responsible: dev, post-kickoff
  value: |
    Red Hat 3scale API Management Development builds on the knowledge of API management skills gained by the students in the Red Hat 3scale API Management Foundations course. The students get the opportunity to do hands-on labs  using Red Hat 3scale API Management hosted on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

    The focus of the course is exposing students to the various aspects of managing APIs. Standard API management practices are covered, including services, application plans, users and accounts, applications, and rate limits. The course also covers managing SOAP or ODATA web services using Red Hat 3scale API Management.

    After completing this course, students will be able to create a custom Developer Portal for managing end-user signup flows, create ActiveDocs documentation, and provide custom workflows. Students will also know how to customize sections of the portal using the Liquid API and CSS/HTML, customize APIcast using Lua scripts, and use 3scale API code plug-ins to handle non-standard service requests or analytics requirements.
