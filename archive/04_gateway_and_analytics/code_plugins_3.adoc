Transcript:


Plug-ins support the three main calls to the 3scale back end:

* `authrep` grants access to your API and reports the traffic on it in one call.
* `authorize` grants access to your API.
* `report` reports traffic on your API.

3scale supports three authentication modes: app ID, user key, and OAuth. The first two are similar on their calls to the back end--they support `authrep`. OAuth differs in its usage--two calls are required: `authorize` and then `report`.
