Transcript:


Plans are used for granting access to specific APIs and endpoints, limiting traffic, and monetizing API usage. Red Hat 3scale API Management has four different types of plans that can be used on their own or together.

Application plans are the most common type of plans. They let you configure access rights to an API by specifying rate limits and pricing rules. All applications must be associated with a plan. Application plans can be customized for each application.
