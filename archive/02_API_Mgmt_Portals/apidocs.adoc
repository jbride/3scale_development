Transcript:

Red Hat 3scale API Management offers a framework to create interactive documentation for your API.

With Swagger 2.0, based on the Swagger specification, you can have functional, attractive documentation for your API that helps your developers to explore, test, and integrate with your API.

When you add a new service specification, you must provide the following:

* The service name
* The system name, which is required to reference the service specification from the Developer Portal
* Whether you want the specification to be published or hidden
* A description meant only for your consumption
* The API JSON specification, which is the secret ingredient of ActiveDocs

You must generate the specification of your API according to the specification proposed by Swagger. Red Hat 3scale API Management does not help generate API specifications; it assumes you have a valid Swagger 2.0-compliant specification of your API.
