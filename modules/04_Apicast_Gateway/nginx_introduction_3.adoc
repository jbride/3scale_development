Transcript:

NGINX's modular architecture generally allows developers to extend the set of web server features without modifying the NGINX core. NGINX modules come in slightly different incarnations--namely, core modules, event modules, phase handlers, protocols, variable handlers, filters, upstreams, and load balancers. At this time, NGINX does not support dynamically loaded modules; that is, modules are compiled along with the core at build stage.
