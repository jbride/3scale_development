Transcript:

In order to share the workload of administering your APIs, you may wish to invite team members from your organization to access the 3scale Admin Portal. 

The term users refers to members of the administration team. The 3scale Admin Portal has two types of users:

Admins: Which have full access to all areas and services, and can invite other members.
Members: Which have limited access to areas of the product (e.g. Analytics, Developer Portal) and, if youâ€™re an enterprise customer, also to services.

There are two main type of rights you can give to members of your team:

By area: Such as analytics, billing, or developer administration.
By service: Choose which services to give access to members amongst all of your services. 

Giving members access to certain areas of the 3scale Admin Portal will give them access only to the equivalent API.
