Transcript:

3scale supports single sign on (SS0) authentication for your members and admins.

The admin portal supports the Red Hat SSO & Auth0, each which support a number of identity brokering and member federation options. Only users that have been added to RH SSO or Auth0 will be able to access your 3scale admin portal through SSO. Once you have established SSO through your chosen provider, you must configure it and enable it on the 3scale admin portal. 

Once you have configured SSO, members can sign on using the account credentials in connected IdPs.
