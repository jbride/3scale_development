== Users, Accounts, and Applications Management Lab

.Overview

In this lab you learn techniques for user communication, account management via invitations, and using custom keys for applications. 



.Goals

* Send email message to users
* Send email invitation to add user to account
* Customize user key tokens
* Apply end user rate limits

.Prerequisites
* Completion of the previous labs in this course
* SMTP configured for your API Management Platform (AMP) component to send email messages
* `OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN` environment variable set in your shell
+
TIP: To check if your shell still has this environment variable set, execute the `echo $OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN` command. If the variable is no longer set, return to the first lab in this course and follow the steps there to set it again.

* Admin Portal URL and user credentials to log in

== Send Email

In this section you see how a 3scale API Management administrator can send an email message to any registered account user.

=== Reconfirm SMTP Setup

. Log in to your OpenShift Management Console and navigate to *Resources -> Config Maps -> smtp*.
. Check that the ConfigMap shows the SMTP credentials as configured:
+
image::images/ocp_amp_config_map_smtp.png[]
+
NOTE: Note that the setup stores the password as plain text, so use a separate account as your SMTP instead of your personal email account.
+
. If the smtp ConfigMap needs to be updated, then you need to bounce the following deployments to reread the configuration:
** `system-app`
** `system-resque`
** `system-sidekiq`


=== Send Message from Admin Portal

. In the 3scale API Management Admin Portal, verify that you are logged in, and then click the *Developers* tab.
. Click the *RHBank* account.
. On the Account Summary page, click *Send Message*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_send_message.png[]

* A pop-up form appears on the page.
. Enter the following values:
* *To*: `RHBank`
* *Subject*: `Test Message`
* *Body*: `This is a test message from the Products API admin team regarding your account. Regards, Admin`
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_send_message_2.png[]

. Verify that the sent message is listed in the *Messages* tab by clicking *Sent messages*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_send_message_5.png[]

=== Confirm Email Receipt in Developer Account

. Confirm that the email has been received in the email ID registered for the user:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_send_message_3.png[]
+
NOTE: The email is sent from the email address registered with AMP for the SMTP credentials.
+
====
IMPORTANT: If you are using a Gmail account, you may encounter an issue with Google blocking the sign-in attempt from the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on AWS. You might notice the following error:

image::images/3scale_amp_email_gmail_error.png[]
====
+
TIP: Log in to your Gmail account and update the permissions in Gmail to permit the login for SMTP.

. Confirm that the email is in the *Sent* folder of the SMTP account:

== Invite User to Join Developer Account

When the developer account for RHBank was created in the previous lab, the account was created for a specific email ID, username, and password. 
In 3scale API Management, multiple users can be created for the same account. 

In this section of the lab, new user's will be invited to account.

You'll do this initially as the 3scale site admin and then do so again as the _RHBank_ account admin.

=== Site Admin: Send Invitation to User's Email Address

. Click the *Developers* tab.
. Click the *RHBank* account.
. Click *Invitations*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user.png[]
+
. Click *Invite user*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_2.png[]
+
. Provide an email address of the user to be invited, and click *send*.
. Observe the status of the invitation on the Invitation page:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_3.png[]
+
NOTE: If the user does not receive the invitation, you can resend the invitation through this link.

=== Accept Invitation and Join

. Log in to the email account of the invitee and look for the invitation email from 3scale API Management:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_4.png[]

. Click the link in the email to join the developer account. This opens the *Invitation Sign In* form on the Developer Portal.
+

NOTE: The Developer Portal is by default restricted behind an access code, so you might encounter an error page after clicking the activation link. To prevent this, go to the *Settings -> Developer Portal* section of Admin Portal and delete the *Developer Portal Access Code*.
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_11.png[]

+
. Provide a username and password, and click *Sign up*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_5.png[]
+
NOTE: An invited user can check their application plan and user key by logging in to the Developer Portal. You observe this workflow in the "Custom Developer Portal" module of the course.

=== Check User in Admin Portal

. Navigate back to the Admin Portal and click *Accounts* and *RHBank*.
. Click *Users*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_6.png[]
+
. Observe that the new user account was created with the role `member`:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_7.png[]
+
. Observe in the Admin Portal that an administrator has the ability to edit, suspend, delete, or update a user, including changing the user's role to the `admin` role:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_8.png[]
+
* Because this user has access to the same applications as the account, the user can request the APIs using the same application keys that were set up for the application.

=== Administer User Account

. Access the Developer Portal and log in as the new user.
. Review your application and credentials in the portal.
. Click *Settings* and try to access the *Users* and *Invitations* links:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_9.jpg[]
+
. Notice that you get an *Access Denied* error because these tabs are reserved for `admin` users.
. Sign out of the Developer Portal.

=== Administer Administrator Account

Previously you created an account called _RHBank_ and an account admin called: _rhbankdev_.

As an account admin, the user _rhbankdev_ can invite other users to the account.

. Log in as an `admin` user of the RHBank account (`rhbankdev`).
. Click the *Users* tab.
. Observe that you can now view the users list, and also invite users using the portal:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_account_invite_user_10.png[]
+
. Repeat the invite-user process through the Developer Portal.

== Regenerate and Customize User Keys

In this section you learn how users can manage the user key for accessing APIs managed by 3scale API Management. You do two procedures: regenerating the random key generated, and letting the user enter a custom key.

=== Regenerate User Key from Admin Portal

. In the Admin Portal, verify that you are logged in, and then click the *Applications* tab.
. Click *ProductsApp*
. Click *Regenerate*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_userkey_regenerate.png[]
+
. Confirm the change by clicking *OK* in the pop-up window and verify that a new user key was generated.
. Try the request to the Product API with the old key and observe the *Authentication Failed* error.
. Retry the request with the new user key and observe that the request succeeds.
+
NOTE: Users can also manage their user key from the Developer Portal. After completing the labs in the "Custom Developer Portal" module, repeat this procedure and regenerate the user key from the Developer Portal.

=== Set Custom Key

. In the Admin Portal, verify that you are logged in, and then click the *Applications* tab.
. Click *ProductsApp*.
. Click *Set Custom Key*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_userkey_custom.png[]
+
. Set an alphanumeric key. Use a phrase/password that is easy to remember.
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_userkey_custom_2.png[]
+
. Observe that the user key was updated to your custom key.
. Test the API request by changing the user key to ensure that it works.
+
NOTE: A custom user key can also be provided in the Developer Portal.  You could perform this procedure again after completing the labs in the "Custom Developer Portal" module, and create the custom key in the Developer Portal. 

== Change Authentication to App ID and App Key

An alternative to using the API key (user key) for authentication is to use a combination of app ID and app key. In this method, the application is identified bny its app ID and then authenticated with the app key. 

In this section you change the authentication for the Products service to use the app ID and app key instead of the API key.

=== Update Service

. In the Admin Portal, verify that you are logged in, and then click the *API* tab.
. For the Products service, click *Integration*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key.png[]
+
. Click *edit integration settings* in the Integration & Configuration page:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_2.png[]
+
. Scroll down to the *Authentication* section, and change the authentication to *App_ID and App_Key Pair*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_3.png[]
+
. Click *Update Service*.
. Click *OK* in the confirmation pop-up window to accept the changes.
. Click  *Applications* and select *ProductsApp*.
. Observe that the *API Credentials* section was changed to reflect the new authentication:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_4.png[]
+
. Click *Add Random key* to provide a new app key for this application.
. Notice that a new application key was generated. 
+
NOTE: You can generate multiple application keys. Generate one more key.


=== Test Authentication

. Navigate to *APIs* and select *Products > Integration & Configuration*.
. Click *edit APIcast configuration*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_5.png[]
+
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and notice that the sample curl request generated has `app_id` and `app_key` prefilled:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_6.png[]
+
. Click *Update & test in Staging Environment and observe that the request succeeds and the integration becomes be green without errors.
. Test the other app key generated and ensure that the request succeeds.
+
NOTE: The app key can be created or deleted through the Developer Portal as well. After you have completed the "Custom Developer Portal" module, revisit this procedure and manage app keys through the Developer Portal. 

=== Change API Docs

Do this section after completing the labs in the "Custom Developer Portal" module. Because the authentication has changed from user key to app ID and app key, you need to update the Swagger API to reflect this change. As a bonus exercise, update the APIDocs as suggested in module 3, substituting the user key with app ID and app key correctly so that test requests can be sent from the Documentation page of the portal to this API endpoint.
