Transcript:

3scale has two types of tokens: Access tokens (created by the user) and Service tokens (automatically created when you create a new service in 3scale). 

Access tokens allow API provider admins and members to authenticate against the 3scale APIs – Billing, Account management, and/or Analytics. An access token may provide either read and write access, or read only. An important thing to take into account is how access tokens work, which is according to the member’s rights. Admins can create tokens to authenticate against all three 3scale APIs. Members will be limited by their permissions to access the different parts of the Admin Portal. For example, if a member doesn’t have access to the Billing area, they won’t be able to create a token to authenticate against the Billing API.

You can create as many access tokens as you need, but take into account that for security reasons, they won’t be stored on 3scale. When you create a new token, you’ll be alerted to save the token so you can then use it to make requests to the 3scale API. If you lose a token, we recommend that you delete it – which will disable it and render it invalid – then create a new one.

Service tokens are used to authenticate against 3scale Service Management API. Service tokens are generated automatically when a new service is created in 3scale, and are unique per service. They are shared among the users of the 3scale account, and the service tokens for the services that the user has access to can be found in Personal Settings > Tokens section of the admin portal.
