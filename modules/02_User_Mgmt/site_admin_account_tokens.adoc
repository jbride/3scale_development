Transcript:

3scale API Management has two types of tokens: access tokens, which are created by the user; and service tokens, which are automatically created when you create a new service. 

Access tokens allow API provider administrators and members to authenticate against the 3scale API Management APIs: Billing, Account Management, and Analytics. An access token may provide either read and write access, or read only access. An important thing to take into account is how access tokens work, which is according to the memberâ€™s rights. Administrators can create tokens to authenticate against all three APIs. Members' access to the different parts of the Admin Portal is limited by their permissions. For example, members who do not have access to the Billing area cannot create a token to authenticate against the Billing API.

You can create as many access tokens as you need, but take into account that for security reasons, they are not stored on 3scale API Management. When you create a new token, you are alerted to save the token so you can then use it to make requests to the APIs. If you lose a token, delete it, which disables it and renders it invalid.  Then create a new one.

Service tokens are used to authenticate against the Service Management API. Service tokens are generated automatically when a new service is created, and are unique per service. They are shared among the users of the account. The service tokens for the services that the user has access to can be found in Personal Settings > Tokens section of the Admin Portal.
