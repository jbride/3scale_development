Transcript:


There is a default admin user with an account subscription access provided. On a Red Hat 3scale API Management platform, usually SaaS, it is the account that the provider uses to log in to 3scale and manage APIs. In the 3scale AMP, this represents the "admin" account to access the Admin Portal.

Both the figures above represent the admin user and signin credentials for accessing the Admin Portal. This is the admin user that has access to the Account Management features of the Admin Portal. This user can create other users/accounts for managing other aspects of administration for providers, as we shall see in the next slide.
