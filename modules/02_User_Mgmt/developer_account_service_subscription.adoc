Transcript:

Developer accounts need to be subscribed to a particular service to have access to the API (service). By default, when a new API service is created in 3scale API Management, a default service plan is created. Any developer account created has a service subscription to the default service plan. The site administrator has the option to unselect the default service plan. In that case, creating an account does not generate a default service subscription for it, and the subscription needs to be set up explicitly by the administrator.

An application connecting the account to an application plan is dependent on the service subscription of the account. Hence, the service subscription is the first step to contract a service to an account.
