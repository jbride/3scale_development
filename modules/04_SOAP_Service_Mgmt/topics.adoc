=== Transcript


This module discusses the API management of non-REST based APIs. 3scale API Management supports the REST API framework as standard. We will discuss the advantages and prevalence of REST APIs in the API Management ecosystem. We will then discuss the other API specifications like SOAP or Thrift, and some approaches to manage non-REST APIs using 3scale.
