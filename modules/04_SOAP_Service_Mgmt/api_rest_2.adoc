== REST API Architecture

* REST is data-driven
* Can permit multiple data formats (JSON, XML, text)
* Security using HTTPS protocol
* Lightweight framework

== REST Limitations for APIs

* Using non-HTTP protocols
* Stateful 
* Constrained by too few HTTP verbs

=== Transcript

REST APIs are based on URIs (Uniform Resource Identifier, of which a URL is a specific type) and the HTTP protocol, and use JSON for a data format. REST is all about simplicity, thanks to HTTP protocols. REST is optimized for the web. Using JSON as its data format makes it compatible with browsers.

RESTful APIs are quite fashionable at the moment. However, you should not
follow this trend just for the sake of that. There are use cases which are very well
suited for it, but there are others which favor other architectural styles.
