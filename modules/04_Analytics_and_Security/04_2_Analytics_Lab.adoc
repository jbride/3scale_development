= Analytics and Security Lab

In this lab, you set up and view the analytics provided by Red Hat 3scale API Management. 

You also export data and events from 3scale API Management so that an external analytics tool can be used.

You start by generating some load for the API and then check the analytics graphics to understand the API traffic.

Towards the end of this lab, you change the security mechanism used on your Products API from _AppKey_ to _AppId + AppKey_.

== Observe Analytics

=== Generate Load on Products API

In this section, you make various requests on your Products API so that this load can be visualized in the analytics portal of the 3scale API Manager in the next section.

. At a terminal winodw, ssh into your remote lab virtual machine
. Create an environment variable for the user key of your _ProductsPremiumApp_ application.
.. You can determine the user key by authenticating into the Developer Portal as the _RHAdmin_ user.
.. At the command line, create the following environment variable:
+
-----
$ PRODUCTS_PREMIUM_APP_USER_KEY=<your user key>
-----

. Add a new product via initiating a POST request to the _/services/product_ resource of the Products API
+
-----
$ curl -v -k -X POST \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
    --header 'Accept: application/json' \
    -d '{  "productid": null, "productname": "Samsung LED TV", "productprice": 299.95 }' \
    https://`oc get route products-staging-route -o template --template {{.spec.host}} -n $GW_PROJECT`:443/rest/services/product?user_key=$PRODUCTS_PREMIUM_APP_USER_KEY

....

{"message":"Product created"}
-----


. Create more products in a similar manner using the following request bodies :
.. {  "productid": null, "productname": "Panasoic LED TV", "productprice": 399.95 }
.. {  "productid": null, "productname": "Panasoic Plasma TV", "productprice": 199.95 }
.. {  "productid": null, "productname": "JVC OLED TV", "productprice": 199.95 }


. In a similar manner, try the `Delete` and `Get Product` methods.


=== API Provider: Observe analytics for all applications

Recall that there are various _applications_ associated with the _Products API_.
In this section of the lab, you will observe the aggregate of all requests of all applications of the Products API.

. In 3scale by Red Hat's Admin Portal, log in to the default tenant.
. Navigate to `API:Products -> Analytics -> Usage`:

. Observe the statistics provided:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_analytics_7.png[]

. Click *Top Applications*, *Daily Averages*, and *Alerts*, and observe the statistics shared.

=== API Provider: Observe analytics for a specific application

. Navigate to `API:Products -> Applications -> Listing`:
. Click the *ProductsPremiumPlan*:

. Click *Analytics* link at the top of the page to view the statistics pertaining to this application:
+

=== API Consumer: Observe analytics for a specific user

. Log in to the Developer Portal as user `rhadmin` with the password you provided for the account.
. Click  the *Statistics* tab:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_analytics_10.png[]

. Observe the statistics for the user's application plan:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_analytics_11.png[]

. Click *Download CSV* at the bottom right to download the analytics data in a CSV format.
* The CSV file can be used as input for an external analytics tool.

== Change Authentication to App ID and App Key

An alternative to using the API key (user key) for authentication is to use a combination of app ID and app key. 
In this method, the application is identified by its app ID and then authenticated with the app key. 

This security mechanism tends to be superior to use of only a simple API key.
The App Id + App key security mechanism provides improved long term management.
Multiple App keys can be generated and each distributed to different API consumers of the same application.
The lifecycle of each of these App keys can be managed independently of eachother and of the application.

In this section you change the authentication for the Products service to use the app ID and app key instead of the API key.

=== Update Service

. In the Admin Portal, verify that you are logged in to the default teant.
. Navigate to `API:Product -> Integration -> Configuration` .
+
. Click *edit integration settings* in the Integration & Configuration page:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_2.png[]
+
. Scroll down to the *Authentication* section, and change the authentication to *App_ID and App_Key Pair*:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_3.png[]
+
. Click *Update Service*.
. Click *OK* in the confirmation pop-up window to accept the changes.
. Navigate to *Applications -> Listing* and select *ProductsApp*.
. Observe that the *API Credentials* section was changed to reflect the new authentication:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_4.png[]
+
. Click *Add Random key* to provide a new app key for this application.
. Notice that a new application key was generated. 
+
NOTE: You can generate multiple application keys. Generate one more key.


=== Test Authentication

. For the _Products_ API, navigate to `Integration -> Configuration`.
. Click *edit APIcast configuration*:
+
. Scroll to the bottom of the page and notice that the sample curl request generated has `app_id` and `app_key` prefilled:
+
image::images/3scale_amp_products_app_appid_key_6.png[]
+
. Click *Update & test in Staging Environment and observe that the request succeeds and the integration becomes be green without errors.
. Test the other app key generated and ensure that the request succeeds.
+
NOTE: The app key can be created or deleted through the Developer Portal as well.
