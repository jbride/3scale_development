=== Transcript

Liquid is a simple programming language used for displaying and processing most of the data from 3scale's system that is available for API providers. Liquid was originally developed by Shopify and is used in many other CMS engines throughout the web. In Red Hat 3scale API Management, it is used to expose server-side data to your API developers, greatly extending the usefulness of the CMS while maintaining a high level of security.

Liquid is good for:

* Altering the DOM and content of a page based on server-side data
* Adding logic to pages, layouts, and partials
* Manipulating the email templates sent to developers
