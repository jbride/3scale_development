Transcript:

To share the workload of administering your APIs, you may wish to invite team members from your organization to access the Admin Portal.

The term _users_ refers to members of the administration team. The Admin Portal has two types of users, defined by role:

* `admin` users have full access to all areas and services, and can invite other members.
* `member` users have limited access to areas of the product--for example, analytics, the Developer Portal, and, if youâ€™re an enterprise customer, also to services.

Members of your team can be assigned rights in two ways:

* *By area*: Such as analytics, billing, or developer administration.
* *By service*: Choose which services to give access to members.

Giving members access to certain areas of the Admin Portal gives them access only to the equivalent API.
