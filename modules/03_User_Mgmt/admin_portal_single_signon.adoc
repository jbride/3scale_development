Transcript:

3scale API Management supports single sign-on authentication for members and administrators.

The Admin Portal supports Red Hat SSO and Auth0, each of which supports a number of identity brokering and member federation options. Only users that have been added to Red Hat SSO or Auth0 can access the Admin Portal through SSO. Once you have established SSO through your chosen provider, you must configure it and enable it on the Admin Portal.

Once you have configured SSO, members can sign on using the account credentials in the connected Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IdPs).
