== Metrics


* Tracks calls to API
* Cumulative
* Built-in top-level Hits metric
* Other metrics can be added:
** Megabytes
** CPU time
** Number of elements
** Other meaningful units
* Finer granularity by combining with methods

Transcript:


Metrics let you track the usage of your API. Hits is the built-in metric. It exists in each API service and is used to track the hits made to your API. You can achieve finer granularity for the API usage tracking by defining methods under the Hits metric.

To measure usage not based on API hits, you can define new metrics and report the usage in different units. A unit can be anything meaningful--megabytes, CPU time, number of elements returned by the API, and so on.

You see the the usage reported to metrics and methods in the Analytics section.
