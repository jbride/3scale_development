== API Mapping Rules


* Map incoming calls to API endpoints
* Use relative PATH to the methods
* Different HTTP operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc) can be tracked separately.
* Provide Usage tracking, endpoint access and limits for methods/metrics, configured with mapping rules

=== Transcript

After you define your API creating methods and metrics, you can map your API endpoints or paths to the methods you’ve just defined.

Choose the HTTP method, available on the specific endpoint path, and select the equivalent method to map against. Different operations (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc…​) on the same endpoint can be tracked separately.

Usage tracking, endpoint access and limits are based on the methods and metric[metrics] that are configured with these mapping rules.
