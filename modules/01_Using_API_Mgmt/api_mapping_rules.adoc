== API Mapping Rules


* Map incoming calls to API endpoints
* Use relative path to methods
* Different HTTP operations can be tracked separately (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc.)
* Provide usage tracking, endpoint access, and limits based on methods/metrics configured with mapping rules

Transcript:

After you define your API by creating methods and metrics, you can map your API endpoints or paths to the methods.

Choose the HTTP method available on the specific endpoint path and select the equivalent method to map against. Different operations such as `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE`, and so on, on the same endpoint can be tracked separately.

Usage tracking, endpoint access, and limits are based on the methods and metrics that are configured with these mapping rules.
