=== Transcript


This module introduces the API Traffic Management agents for 3scale, chiefly the APICast gateway. APICast Gateway is a thin reverse proxy handling API requests, enforcing policies and security, and routing to the application API endpoint. It is built on NGinx, Lua and OpenResty. It has certain pre-configured components and configurations to help with API traffic management. We also look into adding custom modules and configurations to enhance the default functionality of the gateway.
