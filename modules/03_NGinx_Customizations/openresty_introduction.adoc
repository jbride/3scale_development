=== Transcript

OpenResty® is a full-fledged web platform that integrates the standard Nginx core, LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web services, and dynamic web gateways. OpenResty® is not an Nginx fork. It is just a software bundle.

LuaJIT is a Just-In-Time Compiler for the Lua programming language. lua-nginx-module is an nginx module which makes it possible to handle http request directly in nginx using Lua.
