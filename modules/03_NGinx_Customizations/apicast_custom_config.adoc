=== Transcript

Sometimes you might require injecting custom nginx configuration into the gateway for customization. For example to add another server block to handle some routing. This does not override existing configuration. So the gateway will work as usual + your extra configuration.

That can be done very easily just adding the conf file to the container in the appropriate config location.
