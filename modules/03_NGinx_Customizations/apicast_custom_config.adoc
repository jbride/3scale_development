Transcript:

Sometimes you may need to inject a custom NGINX configuration into the gateway for customization--for example, to add another server block to handle some routing. This does not override the existing configuration. The gateway works as usual plus your extra configuration.

That can be done very easily by just adding the configuration file to the container in the appropriate location.
