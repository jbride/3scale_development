Transcript:

The nine phases on NGINX for which APIcast modules exist are shown here. The behavior of APIcast is customizable via policies. A policy basically tells APIcast what it should do in each of the NGINX phases.

Policies can share data. They do that through what is called the context. Policies can read from and modify the context in every phase.
