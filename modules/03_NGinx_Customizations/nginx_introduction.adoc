=== Transcript

APIcast is an NGINX based API gateway used to integrate your internal and external API services with 3scaleâ€™s API Management Platform.

nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. According to Netcraft, nginx served or proxied 30.17% busiest sites in December 2017. 

The architecture of nginx is modular and event based. nginx has one master and several worker processes; worker processes run under an unprivileged user.The way nginx and its modules work is determined in the configuration file. By default, the configuration file is named nginx.conf. 

nginx uses multiplexing and event notifications heavily, and dedicates specific tasks to separate processes. Connections are processed in a highly efficient run-loop in a limited number of single-threaded processes called workers. Within each worker nginx can handle many thousands of concurrent connections and requests per second.
