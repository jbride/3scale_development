Transcript:

The Red Hat 3scale API Management development team has extended the NGINX modules and created libraries for use with the APIcast gateway. Some of these libraries, like the Caching DNS resolver, load balancer, and HTTP client, are available for extension. There are also other libraries that are primarily intended for internal use--for example, the API mashups, routers/proxies, and IP whitelist and blacklist libraries.
