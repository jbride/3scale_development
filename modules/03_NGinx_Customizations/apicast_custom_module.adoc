Transcript:

To customize APIcast, whether to change a behavior by overriding a function or extending the configuration, you must change the default APIcast module. This can be achieved either by editing the APIcast configuration or by creating a custom module and using inheritance to plug in the new functionality at the appropriate NGINX phase.

Some of the use cases for customization are to support CORS headers, use custom authentication or custom headers, provide time-restricted access to APIs, and limit the number of opened connections for the API.
