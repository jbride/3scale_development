=== Transcript

Plugins are deployed within your API code to insert a traffic filter on all calls as shown in the figure.

The plugin supports the 3 main calls to the 3scale backend:

* authrep grants access to your API and reports the traffic on it in one call.
* authorize grants access to your API.
* report reports traffic on your API.

3scale supports 3 authentication modes: App Id, User Key and OAuth. The first two are similar on their calls to the backend, they support authrep. OAuth differs in its usage two calls are required: first authorize then report.
